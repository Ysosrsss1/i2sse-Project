## Introduction
 Our i2sse Project recieved a subject (Captain), object (Hair) and an activity (Bouncing), which our team decided on two animation programs. 
 The first program is to going to show an animation of a captain on the moon bouncing whereas the second animation is going to be about an animation of a girl's hair waving or flowing.
 We expect that the first program must include a captain either as image or sketch bouncing on the moon aswell as being easily recogonizable to the user. 
 We want to create a program that shows a captain bounce from one place to a place where the user has clicked which enables this program to be engaging with the user.
 The second program is about an animation of girl's hair either flowing or waving. We expect that the program must include either an image or sketch of girl's hair aswell as implemting a program that displays the hair.
 We must add the flowing or waving animation part to the girl's hair so whenever the user interacts with it by clicking the animation, it would make it engaging.
