# Interim report

Before the deadline, download a PDF version of this report, and submit it on iLearn. We will mark the report uploaded on iLearn.

Use the structure below for your report. Remove lines 3 and 5 of the markdown file.

## Introduction

 - Provide a brief description of the topic, what the two programs will do, and what to expect.

## User Stories and Requirements
 - User story : As a user, I want to see an animation of a Captain bouncing on the moon

 - Requirement : The program should show a captain bouncing

Tasks :

 Design a sketch or image for a captain
 Create a program that shows the Captain
 Animate the figure bouncing
 Include some user interaction

Acceptance criteria :

 Captain is easily recognisable
 The figure is animated
 The user can interact with the figure

 User story : As a user , I want to see an animation of hair waving or flowing, so that I can see it move.

Tasks :

 Sketch or create an image of a hair
 Implement a program that displays the hair
 Determine how to animate " flowing "
 Add the flowing animation to the hair
 Implement user interaction with the animation

Acceptance criteria :

 Given the Processing Program , when the user presses the play button , then the hair flows .
 Given a running program , when the user clicks on the hair , then the hair stops flowing .

## User Acceptance Tests
 - Define test cases for user stories and requirements that your team decided to test as part of user acceptance testing. 
 - Show that these tests cover the most important aspects of the two programs.

## Coding Guidelines
 -The preferred coding text style are; 
  -Camel case
  -comments to be used as frequently as possible through //to verify what certain codes are doing,
  -variables to be in words not single digits,
  -modularization,
  -consistent testing,
  -communication
 
## Project Management
 - List the tasks and issues that are currently on your project board, and their status. Include who has been assigned to do the job, and who will be responsible for reviewing the tasks before it is moved to the `Done` column.
 Our given taks were to program an animation of a "Captin" which is our subject and the action with the subject being "bouncing", this will be established with an image of the captin black beard bouncing on the moon. The obejct is "hair", and this will be a shown by a girl on a mountain with her hair brezzing.
The  
 
 - Explain which methods you will use for code review. Note, that reviewing a task, and reviewing code, are two separate activities.
 - Explain the overall progress with respect to the mid-semester milestone.
