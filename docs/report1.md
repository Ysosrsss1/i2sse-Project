## Introduction
 Our i2sse Project recieved a subject (Captain), object (Hair) and an activity (Bouncing), which our team decided on two animation programs. 
 The first program is to going to show an animation of a captain on the moon bouncing whereas the second animation is going to be about an animation of a girl's hair waving or flowing.
 We expect that the first program must include a captain either as image or sketch bouncing on the moon aswell as being easily recogonizable to the user. 
 We want to create a program that shows a captain bounce from one place to a place where the user has clicked which enables this program to be engaging with the user.
 The second program is about an animation of girl's hair either flowing or waving. We expect that the program must include either an image or sketch of girl's hair aswell as implemting a program that displays the hair.
 We must add the flowing or waving animation part to the girl's hair so whenever the user interacts with it by clicking the animation, so it becomes engaging.
 
## User Stories and Requirements
 - User story : As a user, I want to see an animation of a Captain bouncing on the moon, so that i can interact with the captain bouncing.

 - Requirement : The program should show a captain bouncing.

Tasks :
 Design a sketch or image for a captain.
 Create a program that shows the Captain.
 Animate the figure bouncing.
 Include some user interaction.

Acceptance criteria :

 Captain is easily recognisable.
 The figure is animated.
 The user can interact with the figure.

  - User story : As a user , I want to see an animation of a girl's hair waving or flowing, so that I can see it move.

  - Requirement : The program should show Hair.

Tasks :
 Sketch or create an image of a hair.
 Implement a program that displays the hair.
 Determine how to animate " flowing ".
 Add the flowing animation to the hair.
 Implement user interaction with the animation.

Acceptance criteria :

Hair is recognisable.
Object is animated.
The use can interact with the object.
When the user clicks the hair must start waving or flowing and when the user clicks again it should stop.

## User Acceptance Tests
User Story 1- As a user, I want to see an animation of a Captain bouncing on the moon, so that i can interact with the captain bouncing.

Test case 1-Verify that the user can interact and move the captain in the animation.
Steps: 
1- The user opens and runs CaptainBouncing.pde.
2- The user clicks on the mouse where he wants the captain to bounce to.
Expected outcome: The captain should bounce from his origin to the area where the mouse clicked.
Test Results:
Pass- The Captain bounces from his origin to the area the user has clicked.
Fail- The Captain doesn't bounce from His origin to the area the user has clicked.

User story 2- As a user , I want to see an animation of a girl's hair waving or flowing, so that I can see it move.

Test case 2- Verify that the user can interact and make the hair flow in the animation.
Steps: 
1- The user opens and runs Hair.pde.
2- The user clicks on the mouse and the Hair should start flowing and stop when the use clicks again.
Expected outcome: The hair should start from flowing once the user clicks and stop once the user does it again.
Test Results:
Pass- The hair flows once the user has clicked and stops once the user has clicked again.
Fail- The hair doesn't flow whether the user clicks or not.


Test case 1 Covers user story 1 which is about a program that has to include a captain bouncing. 
This test covers all of the tasks and all of the acceptance criteria which covers every important aspect of this program.
Test case 2 covers user story 2, about a program that has to include hair.
This test covers 4/5 of the tasks missing out on 'determing how to animate hair' and includes all of the accpetance criteria.
Both these tests cover majority of the most important aspects of the both programs which helps us guide through creating these programs and testing both of these animations effortlessly.

## Coding Guidelines
 -The preferred coding text style are :
  -Camel case
  -comments to be used as frequently as possible through //to verify what certain codes are doing,
  -variables to be in words not single digits,
  -modularization,
  -consistent testing,
  -communication
 
## Project Management
Our given taks were to program an animation of a "Captin" which is our subject and the action with the subject being "bouncing", this will be established with an image of the captin black beard bouncing on the moon which will be completed by Ibby and Mohamad.
So far this task is in the In Progress column with Ali and Efe reviewing it before it is moved to the done column. 
The second task was to make an animation about our obejct, which is "hair", and this will be a shown by a girl on a mountain with her hair brezzing which will be completed by Ali and Efe.
So far this task is in the In progress column with Ibby and Mohamad reviewing it before it is moved to the done column.
We had two more issues which are requirements, that were to upadate the Readme file aswell as finishing the To-Do list.
The Update Readme issue is in the Done column being reviewed by the Whole group, whereas the To-Do list is still In Progress which will be reviewed by the whole group before it is moved to the Done column.
 
 - Explain which methods you will use for code review. Note, that reviewing a task, and reviewing code, are two separate activities.
 - Explain the overall progress with respect to the mid-semester milestone.
